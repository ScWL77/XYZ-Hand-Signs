# XYZ-Hand-Signs

This is a Machine Learning AI project where me and my groupmates train two different models: InceptionV3 and VGG16 to recognize the three different hand signs: X, Y, Z. 

I was in charge of gathering parts of the three different datasets: training, testing and validation. Furthermore, I used Python with libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn to incorporate to my group's code to create data visualization for the loss and accuracy loss graphs as well as confusion matrix of our models.
